# ThDilos-Protogen-Origin
A half-finished origin that I have no time and motivation to continue further.

Feels like it's a waste to keep it for myself. So I uploaded it into Github as a public repo\

Basic Idea:\
Protogen Origin With Multiple Upgradable Modules\
First you start as [Damaged Protogen], which you are full of vulnerabilities.\
You need to collect iron, copper and gold to craft Nanites, then use the skill to repair yourself.\
With each repair, part of your body returns normal, you can sense your vulnerabilities going away.

After 10th fix, you become [Protogen], with no aforementioned vulnerabilities.\
Then, according the original plan, there are multiple specialised modules for you to unlock via various ways.\
You can swap between modules and the base protogen form, just like how my fox origin is.\
For example:
1. A Mining Modules that equip you with multiple resource-gathering abilities.\
From as small as mining speed boost to activatable mining laser / explosives etc.
2. An assassin Modules that grants you speed, power, while forgo nearly all defence you have.
3. A remote-strike module that allow you to carry out some long-range artilery attack.
4. A Deep-Sea Exploration Module that give you much mobilities and capabilities when under water.
5. A Air-Superiority Module that allows you to fly fast and constantly, being able to drop bombs down.

There are many possibilities for modules...

I have finished (unpolished) the Base Protogen. Which includes:
- All stages of Damaged Protogen, all the abilities and skills
- All the way until you are finally fixed and turn into a normal protogen

The next step is literally the creativity coding part, but I'm just too tired to continue.

Actually it can be a complete origin itself right now, but to me it's just forever unfinished\
It even has all the custom sprites / models

If you somehow stumble upon this repository, and find my Protogen idea interesting. Let me know by starring ig




Power Introduction\
Origin Layer: Protogen\
Description: Protogens are 40% artificial cyborg, created for space exploration. Weakness of Flesh shall not contain them from the boundless horizon.
1. Power Array: Select the activated skill to use
2. Nanites Manipulation: Being a special Protogen, you can command your nanites to create, or destroy (In game is create special sword, temperal shield, emergency healing and stuff)
3. Visor Enhanced Vision: Your visor helps you to observe the world better. (In game is night vision + see nearby entities with a screen effect)
4. Storage Space: You have a built-in storage space to store items.
5. Synthetic Body: You are shorter than human being, but have more endurance. (Shrink size and more health)
6. Artificial Limbs: Your limbs are artificially crafted for you to better navigate the environment. (Fall endurance, faster mining swimming speed)
7. Natural Armor: You are harder than steel, and fluffy at the same time. (More Defence, vulnerable to fire)
8. BioEnergy: Your nanites help you fully digest any foods you eat, convert part of them into energy to power your artificial components. (More food points and saturation from foods, ignore any effects from eating, your activated skill will make you hungry)
9. Overheating: Your components will mulfunction if you don't keep yourself cool. (Multiple factors will decide your temperature, like environment, items you hold, skills you activated etc. Your damage will decrease if you're too hot, along with some fire damage and cool visual effects if reach the hottest threshold.)

Module Layer: Damaged\
Description: Your body was severely damaged from your last landing on this foreign planet. Be aware of your surroundings.
1. Self Fixing: An emergency protocol to repair significant damage. (Basically how you fix yourself)
2. Unstable Nanites: Your nanites control module is damaged. (Removed at 10th fix. Halved Nanites Capacity, Reduced Nanites shield counts, inferior nanites sword.)
3. Short Circuit: Your body armor and insulation layer is cracked, vulnerable circuits are exposed to the outsides. (Removed at 9th fix. No more armor from the Natural armor skill, Cannot touch water)
4. Damaged Storage: The storage space was punctured through, there is a giant hole leaking out. (Removed at 8th fix. The storage space is reduced)
5. Coordinator Failure: Coordinator was damaged, you can't control your movement fluidly. (Removed at 7th fix. No fall protection, reduced mining, swimming, movement speed)
6. Mulfunctioned Visor: An unknown error occured in your visor's neuro-transmission link. At least it's better than a crack in the inner visor. (Removed at 6th fix. Cannot use Night Vision, random blindness effect)
7. Unstable Socket: Socets are essential to connect all your exchangable limbs. Your left arm socket howeverm was not functioning properly. (Removed at 4th fix. Occasionally drop item in your offhand)
8. Impaired Healing: Your body has not adjusted to this forign environment, yet. (Removed at 3rd fix. Reduced regen speed)
9. Nutritional Loophole: The food digesting nanites have not work out how to decompose these foods. (Removed at 1st fix. Disabled perfect digestion, increased base exhaustion)

After 10th fix, evolve into Module Layer: Functional\
It just means you completed the fix, no special effect at all.\
It's planned to have the skill that allows you to unlock specialised modules

That's about it.\
A bold project for sure, too bad it's gonna get delayed indefinitely
