# ThDilos-Protogen-Origin
A half-finished origin that I have no time and motivation to continue further.

Feels like it's a waste to keep it for myself. So I uploaded it into Github as a public repo

Basic Idea:\
Protogen Origin With Multiple Upgradable Modules\
First you start as [Damaged Protogen], which you are full of vulnerabilities.\
You need to collect iron, copper and gold to craft Nanites, then use the skill to repair yourself.\
With each repair, part of your body returns normal, you can sense your vulnerabilities going away.

After 10th fix, you become [Protogen], with no aforementioned vulnerabilities.\
Then, according the original plan, there are multiple specialised modules for you to unlock via various ways.\
You can swap between modules and the base protogen form, just like how my fox origin is.\
For example:
1. A Mining Modules that equip you with multiple resource-gathering abilities.\
From as small as mining speed boost to activatable mining laser / explosives etc.
2. An assassin Modules that grants you speed, power, while forgo nearly all defence you have.
3. A remote-strike module that allow you to carry out some long-range artilery attack.
4. A Deep-Sea Exploration Module that give you much mobilities and capabilities when under water.
5. A Air-Superiority Module that allows you to fly fast and constantly, being able to drop bombs down.

There are many possibilities for modules...\ 
I have finished (unpolished) the Base Protogen. Which includes:
- All stages of Damaged Protogen, all the abilities and skills
- All the way until you are finally fixed and turn into a normal protogen

The next step is literally the creativity coding part, but I'm just too tired to continue.

Actually it can be a complete origin itself right now, but to me it's just forever unfinished
